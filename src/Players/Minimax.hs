    game states are encoded in a tree, so we need a function that reduces the depth of a tree.

    A crucial part of the minimax algorithm is defining a good utility function. It should measure
    how good a game position is for the current player. In our case, a game state should be better
    than another one if the player is closer to its winning positions.
